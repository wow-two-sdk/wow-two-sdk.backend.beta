## 0. Verdict legend

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **LOCKED** | Architectural decision. Won't change without proposal. |
| **DONE** | Already shipped (or imported as-is). |
| **NOW** | Active sprint. Implement before next batch. |
| **NEXT** | Plan to start once NOW clears. |
| **LATER** | On the roadmap, not soon. Keep visible so it doesn't drift. |
| **MAYBE** | Unclear — needs triage / spike before commit. |
| **SKIP** | Decided not to implement. Reason given. |

---

## 1. Locked architectural decisions

| # | Decision | LOCKED rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Single big package** — `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta` aggregates every concern; subpath imports per area | Dependency bloat is explicitly accepted. One install, batteries included. Mirrors UI lib's "one big package, subpath exports". |
| 1.2 | **.NET 9 baseline, multi-target later if needed** | Native AOT, HybridCache, first-party OpenAPI, `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` are .NET 9. Don't carry old-runtime debt. |
| 1.3 | **C# 13+ language features freely** | Primary constructors, collection expressions, partial properties, etc. No `LangVersion` floor pinning. |
| 1.4 | **Built-in DI (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`) is the contract** | Don't ship Autofac/Lamar replacements. Consumers can swap if they want — we expose `IServiceCollection` extensions. |
| 1.5 | **Source-gen preferred over reflection** for mapping, JSON, validation, DI graph, regex | AOT-friendly, faster, fewer trim warnings. |
| 1.6 | **AOT-compatible best-effort** | Don't *require* AOT, but every component should compile under `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` without warnings if possible. |
| 1.7 | **Modular Monolith first** — microservices is a deployment choice, not a code shape | Make module boundaries cheap (DI conventions, in-process mediator, Outbox abstractions). Easy escalation path to distributed messaging later. |
| 1.8 | **Clean Architecture × Vertical Slice hybrid** | Layering for the foundation (`tokens`, `primitives`, `domains`); vertical slices inside each domain feature. Borrow the UI lib's `foundation/domain` mental model. |
| 1.9 | **Beta-forever versioning** | `0.x.y`, CI auto-bumps `y` on every merge to `main`. Fix-forward when broken. No CHANGELOG, no PR gates, no required tests. Mirrors UI lib's beta-forever rule. |
| 1.10 | **System.Text.Json default; Newtonsoft only when an external lib forces it** | STJ is now feature-complete enough (polymorphism, source-gen, JsonNode mutability). Newtonsoft pulled in transitively only. |
| 1.11 | **`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>` is the only public log surface** | Internally we may use Serilog, but consumers see `ILogger<T>`. Same pattern for telemetry — `ActivitySource` and `Meter` are the public seams. |
| 1.12 | **No commercial license deps in the core meta-package** | MediatR (commercial 12.0+), AutoMapper (commercial 14.0+), MassTransit (commercial v9+ announced), Duende.IdentityServer (RPL), iText7 (AGPL), Aspose, Spire — all are SKIP for the core. May surface as opt-in adapters in companion packages but never as core dependencies. |
| 1.13 | **Permissive licenses only in core**: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3, BSD-2, MS-PL, Unlicense | LGPL only when it's truly transitive-and-isolated (e.g. linking decisions). AGPL never. |
| 1.14 | **No PR gates, no required tests, push to main** | Beta-forever rule, mirrors UI lib. |
| 1.15 | **Standard + spec before code (per-component)** | Borrow the UI lib pattern — every public abstraction begins as `*.standard.md` (RFC 2119 contract) and `*.spec.md` (concrete API). |
| 1.16 | **Subpath exports per top-level src/ folder** | Consumers can pull `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.web` only, or pull the meta. Modeled on UI lib's `forms/`, `display/`, `nav/` subpaths. |

## 5. Configuration leak point inventory verdict — NEXT

Mirrors §7 of `ideas.md`. For each leak point, define a typed `record TFooOptions(...)` with source-gen `[OptionsValidator]` validation. Group: hosting, auth, DB, cache, messaging, storage, email, SMS/push, search, vector, LLM provider, telemetry, logging sinks, health checks, rate limiting, jobs, feature flags, multi-tenancy, localization, CORS, compression, anti-forgery, DataProtection, HSTS, static files, OpenAPI, gRPC, GraphQL, SignalR, resilience, webhook delivery.

Convention: each module exports `services.AddWowFoo(o => { ... })`. Each option type lives in `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.{module}/Options/`.

## 6. Phase mapping (revised P0–P6, dependency-aware + value-first)

Decoupled from UI lib's P1–P6. Reasoning:

- **Identity moved out of "data + messaging"** — most APIs need auth from day 1 without taking on EF Core.
- **Testing extracted to P0 (parallel track)** — every wrapper must ship with runnable examples; testing scaffold can't be a Phase-4 afterthought.
- **Mediator + ProblemDetails promoted** — these are seams everything else hangs on, not P2 add-ons.
- **Real-time / search / workflow / media demoted** — domain-specific; most apps need 0–2.

| Phase | Bundle | Scope (NOW + NEXT items) | Stop here if… |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 — testing scaffold (parallel track)** | `testing` companion package | `WowTestHost<T>` + Testcontainers fixtures (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, Mongo, Kafka, Azurite) + Verify + AwesomeAssertions + Bogus + WireMock.Net | n/a — never stops; grows with every wrapper |
| **P1 — boot floor** | foundation + `observability` + `web` (basics) | Hosting / DI conventions / Options + source-gen validation / Serilog→`ILogger<T>` seam / OTel SDK + auto-instrumentation / ProblemDetails (built-in + Hellang) / `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` / Health checks (Xabaril core providers) / Rate limiting / Output cache (HybridCache memory mode) / Secure-headers middleware / `TimeProvider` + Cronos / Analyzer pack + `.editorconfig` | "Hello World API with logs/traces/health/openapi/rate-limit/problemdetails" — broadest applicability, lowest risk |
| **P2 — request pipeline + auth** | `mediator` + `validation` + `errors` + `identity` | In-proc mediator (our facade, MediatR-API-compat) / FluentValidation pipeline behavior / `IExceptionHandler` global / **Identity API endpoints + JWT bearer + OIDC** / Vogen + Ardalis.GuardClauses / ErrorOr Result type / OneOf / Idempotency middleware | Stateless API (microservice doing HTTP + JWT + downstream calls) — no DB needed |
| **P3 — persistence + outbound** | `data` + `caching` + `http` | EF Core (SqlServer/Npgsql/Pomelo/Sqlite) + audit interceptor + soft-delete filter / Dapper / EFCore.BulkExtensions / EFCore.NamingConventions / EFCore.Projectables / HybridCache + Redis L2 / Refit + `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` / DbUp + EF Migrations runners | Single-instance API with persistence — no horizontal scale |
| **P4 — distributed essentials** | `messaging` + `jobs` + `comms` | DotNetCore.CAP outbox + inbox / Hangfire (Postgres/Redis storage) / Comms abstractions (`IEmailSender` MailKit, `ISmsSender` Twilio, `IPushSender` FCM/dotAPNS) / Webhook delivery infra (HMAC + retry + DLQ) | Multi-instance reliable distributed services |
| **P5 — multi-tenant + AI + flags** | `tenancy` + `ai` + `feature-flags` | Finbuckle multi-tenancy (per-row default, per-DB option) / `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` + Semantic Kernel + provider adapters / vector store adapters (Pgvector, Redis, Qdrant, Pinecone, Milvus, Chroma) / `Microsoft.FeatureManagement` + OpenFeature seam | SaaS-shaped products with AI features |
| **P6 — heavy domain extensions** | `realtime` + `storage` + `search` + `workflow` + extras | SignalR + Redis backplane + SSE / FluentStorage + ImageSharp + QuestPDF + ClosedXML + CsvHelper + Markdig / Postgres tsvector + OpenSearch adapter / Stateless workflow / Aspire integrations / OpenIddict OIDC server adapter / GraphQL (HotChocolate) / OData / AsyncAPI / Kiota client gen / Native AOT certification / Payment adapters (Stripe.net) / Geo (NetTopologySuite + MaxMind) / Email templating (FluentEmail) / OCR (Tesseract) / Documents (DocFX site) | Domain-complete platform |

**Sequencing principle**: each phase is shippable on its own. Drop out at any phase if your app doesn't need the next layer. P0 grows continuously alongside P1–P6.

## 7. Companion package roadmap (out of core)

Things deliberately **not** in the meta-package. Either license-incompatible, scope-heavy, or niche.

| Companion | Reason |
|---|---|
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.testing` | Test-only; keep core lean |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.aspire-azure` | Azure-only adapters |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.aspire-aws` | AWS-only adapters |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.identity-duende` | Commercial license |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.identity-openiddict` | OSS alt to Duende |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.messaging-masstransit` | Commercial (v9+) |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.messaging-wolverine` | Modern OSS alt |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.graphql-hotchocolate` | Heavy surface |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.odata` | Niche |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.event-sourcing-marten` | Postgres-specific ES |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.event-sourcing-kurrent` | EventStoreDB |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.workflow-elsa` / `.workflow-temporal` | Heavy workflow engines |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.media-ffmpeg` | Native deps |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.media-ocr` | Tesseract / OCR |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.search-elastic` / `.search-opensearch` | Cluster-grade search |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.payments-stripe` | Commerce-domain |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.docs` | DocFX site generator |
| `wow-two-sdk.backend.beta.cli` | Spectre.Console-based CLI scaffolding |

---

## 8. Out-of-scope — explicit list

Things we deliberately won't build, with rationale.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Browser / mobile clients | UI lib's job |
| F# idiomatic surface | C#-first; F# can consume |
| Game engine integration (Unity/Godot) | Out of scope for backend |
| Service Fabric integration | Legacy |
| WCF / SOAP servers | CoreWCF community handles it; SKIP |
| Blazor UI components | UI lib |
| Office Interop (Microsoft.Office.Interop.\*) | Win-only, awful API; use OpenXML instead |
| BinaryFormatter / NRBF write | Insecure; only NRBF read for legacy |
| MSMQ transport | Legacy |
| WebForms / ASP.NET 4.x | Legacy |
| Razor.Web Pages legacy | Use Razor Pages or Blazor |
| Custom DI container | MS DI is the contract |
| Custom JSON serializer | STJ is the contract |
| Custom logging facade | `ILogger<T>` is the contract |
| Twitter/X authentication | Sunset API v1.1; use the X v2 OIDC if needed |
| IdentityServer4 integration | EOL |
| Personalizer / MetricsAdvisor / AnomalyDetector adapters | Azure retiring 2026 |

## 9. Decisions still pending — resolve before P3

| # | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | Mediator: hand-rolled facade vs `Mediator` (martinothamar) source-gen | Spike both; perf + license matter |
| 9.2 | Outbox: DotNetCore.CAP vs Wolverine | Both MIT; CAP simpler scope, Wolverine more capable |
| 9.3 | FluentAssertions v7 vs AwesomeAssertions vs Shouldly | License pressure on FA v8+; pick OSS path |
| 9.4 | Default cache: HybridCache vs FusionCache | FusionCache richer; HybridCache first-party |
| 9.5 | OutputCache adapter: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OutputCaching.StackExchangeRedis` vs custom HybridCache adapter | Redundancy if HybridCache covers it |
| 9.6 | OpenAPI: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` only vs Swashbuckle fallback | OpenAPI 3.1 gaps in MS impl? Verify |
| 9.7 | Multi-tenancy default: per-row vs per-DB | Pick one as default; offer both |
| 9.8 | Identity API endpoints (.NET 8+ minimal) vs full ASP.NET Core Identity scaffolding | Likely both, with the minimal API endpoints as the bundled default |
| 9.9 | Real-time default: SignalR alone vs SignalR + SSE side-by-side | Both — SignalR for bidi, SSE for LLM streams |
| 9.10 | gRPC: ship as core or as companion | Bundle adds ~medium cost; might be companion |
| 9.11 | NodaTime: core dep vs companion | If included, all internal time types use it; spec-impact |
| 9.12 | License audit on every transitive dep | One-pass check before P1 ships; document |
| 9.13 | AOT compatibility matrix per subpath | Spike each; document support level |
| 9.14 | Source-gen vs Roslyn analyzer enforcement of foundation/domain rule | UI lib uses ESLint; we need a Roslyn analyzer |
| 9.15 | Whether to include Aspire integrations in core or only as companion | Aspire is the orchestration story; likely companion |

---

## 10. Sequencing summary (TL;DR)

**P0 (parallel track, ongoing)** — `testing` companion: `WowTestHost<T>` + Testcontainers fixtures + Verify + AwesomeAssertions + Bogus + WireMock.Net. Ships *with* P1 so every wrapper has runnable examples on day 1.

**P1 (boot floor)** — broadest-applicability defaults: Hosting / DI / Options + validators / Serilog→ILogger seam / OTel auto-instrumentation / ProblemDetails / `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` / Health checks / Rate limiting / Output cache / Secure headers / `TimeProvider` / Analyzer pack.

**P2 (request pipeline + auth)** — the seam everything else hangs on: in-proc mediator / FluentValidation pipeline / `IExceptionHandler` / Identity API endpoints + JWT + OIDC / Vogen + Guard clauses / ErrorOr + OneOf / Idempotency.

**P3 (persistence + outbound)** — EF Core + audit/soft-delete + Dapper + bulk + HybridCache + Redis + Refit + resilience.

**P4 (distributed essentials)** — DotNetCore.CAP outbox + Hangfire jobs + comms abstractions + webhook infra.

**P5 (SaaS-shaped)** — Finbuckle multi-tenancy + `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` + Semantic Kernel + vector store adapters + feature flags.

**P6 (heavy domain extensions)** — SignalR + storage + search + workflow + Aspire integrations + OpenIddict + GraphQL + OData + AOT cert + payments + geo + OCR + docs site.

Beta-forever rule applies throughout — fix-forward, no version gates, push to main, breaking changes go in normally.
